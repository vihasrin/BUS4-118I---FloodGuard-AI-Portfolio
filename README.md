# BUS4-118I---FloodGuard-AI-Portfolio
## Flooduard AI: What is it?
The name reflects its core mission—acting as a guard against flood-related challenges by using the power of AI. "Flood" represents the natural disaster the platform addresses, while "Guard" emphasizes its role in safeguarding lives and property. The "AI" showcases the innovative generative AI technology driving the platform’s features. 
## Project Summary
FloodGuardAI was designed to help communities prepare for and respond to floods using generative AI. I worked on features like a website data extractor with OpenAI, a personalized flood advisor, and a real-time flood map for reporting and visualizing floods. One challenge was combining different data sources while ensuring accuracy and usability, which required teamwork and problem-solving. The project provides valuable tools to support communities and authorities in managing flood risks, showing how AI can make a positive social impact.
