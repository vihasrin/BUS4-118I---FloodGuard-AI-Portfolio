# BUS4-118I---FloodGuard-AI-Portfolio
## Flooduard AI: What is it?
The name reflects its core mission—acting as a guard against flood-related challenges by using the power of AI. "Flood" represents the natural disaster the platform addresses, while "Guard" emphasizes its role in safeguarding lives and property. The "AI" showcases the innovative generative AI technology driving the platform’s features. 
## Project Summary
FloodGuardAI was designed to help communities prepare for and respond to floods using generative AI. I worked on features like a website data extractor with OpenAI, and a real time flood map for reporting and visualizing floods. One challenge was combining different data sources while ensuring accuracy and usability, which required teamwork and problem-solving. The project provides valuable tools to support communities and authorities in managing flood risks, showing how AI can make a positive social impact.

## Ethical Design
FloodGuardAI was designed with strong ethical principles to ensure user trust and safety. Privacy was prioritized by collecting minimal data, ensuring that users could access features without compromising personal information. The data used was sourced accurately from trusted organizations like Valley Water, ensuring reliable and credible outputs. Generative AI was used responsibly and minimally, focusing only on essential features to avoid unnecessary complexities or risks. Additionally, the platform provided users with simple, clear options to access practical safety tips, ensuring ease of use and empowering individuals to take control of their flood preparedness efforts.
## Why FloodGuard AI?
FloodGuardAI was created to empower individuals and communities with tools to better prepare for and respond to floods. It provides practical safety tips through curated website links, helping users safeguard themselves and their assets. A detailed map highlights high risk flood areas in San Jose, offering critical information for planning and awareness. Real time flood reporting enables users to share updates directly, while user-contributed flood images add valuable insights into current conditions. These features work together to deliver timely and actionable information, making FloodGuardAI a reliable companion for managing flood risks effectively.

*This GitHub portfolio was generated with the help of ChatGPT. I used ChatGPT to refine my project description for FloodGuardAI, including explaining key features like the website data extractor (Project Summary) and the real time flood map (Why FloodGuard AI?). ChatGPT also assisted in crafting sections like the Ethical Design, where I outlined the platform's privacy and data sourcing principles. The tool was referenced throughout to improve clarity and overall presentation of the content.*
